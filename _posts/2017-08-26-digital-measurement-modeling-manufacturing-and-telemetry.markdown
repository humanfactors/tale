## New Approaches to Archiving Art, Artefacts and Sacred Sites


## Abstract

This is an interdisciplinary study that aims to test whether accurate, useful and new archival material can be generated in a safe and proper way with a range of objects in the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory’s collection using digital mapping techniques. Furthermore, it will test whether this new archival material can be used to make, with the aid of computer assisted design and digital manufacturing, an exhibition in a separate location in a way that is both accurate, stimulating and true to the original objects.

Documents, and “flat art” have long been able to be recorded and archived, replicated and transported by museums, libraries and art galleries. However, historically it has been challenging for archivists to capture all the qualities of three dimensional art and artefacts, to say nothing of sacred and historic sites. New technologies allow for new kinds of information to be generated and stored about three dimensional objects, techniques including cloud computing, photogrammetry, computer assisted design and digital manufacturing make it possible not only to capture the dimensions and topology of an object but also to create virtual models that retain the colours, detailing and decorations of the original objects including, if desired, their environment. Furthermore, with the increasing availability and lowering cost of digital manufacturing tools, such as 3D printing, it is possible to convert these virtual models into accurate physical replicas. These techniques potentially allow objects that are geographically isolated, non-transportable or otherwise difficult to access by researchers, stake holders or the public to be digitally archived and recreated in some form, be it a physical model, a projection or a virtual simulation and then disseminated to the appropriate audiences, cheaply, accurately and safely. This study aims to explore the viability of these techniques, for this purpose, in the context of the Northern Territory and Climate Change.

This figure shows three rendered versions of the model with the colours and patterns of the original object. The forth version of the model is a wireframe showing the “triangular mesh points” created from the measurements taken from the photogrammetry data.


## Problem Statement

The Museu­m and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory (MAGNT) has a large collection of art objects, artefacts and items of a natural historical nature (such as fossils and specimens of plants and animals). Only a portion of this collection can be on display at any one time, apart from the published photographs and prints, much of the collection is only available to researchers and members of the public who are physically in Darwin. However, photographs and prints do not always carry all the relevant information about three dimensional objects, which make up a large proportion of the museum’s collection. Furthermore, due to the often ancient, rare and delicate nature of these objects they cannot be loaned or moved or examined without both risk and high cost.


## Hypothesis

This study will test the effectiveness of a range of techniques for the documentation and sharing of significant objects without the need for them to be moved from their current location.

Figure 2. Virtual model of a site of historic value, an abandoned bunker. The first image is one of the photographs of the site that was used to generate the virtual models, the second and third images are screen captures of the virtual model that was generated. This figure shows the model from two different angles, including one that indicates the location of the camera as the photographs were taken, in this case the camera was deployed on a drone.


## Methodology

This study will use a combination of photogrammetry, digital modeling tools, computer assisted design and 3D printing to document and produce physical replicas and archival materials related to objects and sites. Key to this project is the technique of photogrammetry, a process whereby measurements are taken from individual points on a photograph and by combining multiple overlapping photographs taken from different angles and analyzing the relationships between the various point measurements relating to the same feature, the software (in this case Autodesk Remake) then generates a three dimensional virtual model of the object or environment. These models are also able to be manipulated and explored using this program. Furthermore, they can be exported directly from Autodesk Remake to 3D printers, “game engines” and video editing and production software.

Because Autodesk Remake uses colour photographs as the input the process has the added advantage of being able to transfer both the colors and patterns that appear on the original objects and environments onto the virtual models. However, this technique is therefore dependent on the lighting, the quality of the camera and the capabilities of the photographer. In this case the camera being used will be Nikon D3100 in conjunction with a tripod. Adequate and safe lighting options will be explored with MAGNT’s curatorial staff as will access to the objects and guidelines about their safe and proper handling and documentation.


## Justification

So what relevance does digital archiving have to a warming world? A world of rapidly eroding coastlines, expanding deserts, toxifying bodies of water, shrinking forests, bleaching reefs, urbanization and species extinction. A world of mass migration, some for benign economic reasons but also many millions who are displaced or refugees, in a world where whole countries are disappearing under rising waves.

What does cultural heritage or a connection to country and the land mean if people cannot go home, or if their home has been so radically transformed as to be unrecognizable, or if their homes now no longer exist. When families and kinship groups live not only internationally but intercontinentally.

The capacity to quickly and cheaply map, model and digitally archive art, artefacts, sacred and historic sites seems strikingly timely. Crucially this technique retains important information about the coloring and decorations that the objects and sites bear. There is now a possibility not only to archive objects in museums but also the objects in temples, churches, initiation sites, dancehalls, craftsman’s workshops and farmer’s fields and sites that contain fossils, geological features, archeology and biodiversity.

While this technology will no doubt find use in the academy and research, publicly and privately available online archives hold promise for education, activism and as a resource for diaspora communities to maintain their cultural practices. This is not only an opportunity to create a digital bank of objects and places in the event of their possible degradation or destruction but is a chance for people to become aware of their own history both natural and cultural and potentially inspire them to reconnect, steward and restore these objects and places for the generations to come.

Figure 3. Virtual model of an item of cultural value, a sculpture shown from various angles. This figure shows three rendered versions of the model with different “skins” one showing the colour and lighting of the original, one with no colouring but the decorations and detailing highlighted in high contrast and one showing the no colour or contrast, just the topology of the sculpture. The forth rendering shows a model with the colour and lighting of the original object from a different angle and with increased “zoom”.


## Background

D’Arcy Ellis is studying a Bachelor of Science at Charles Darwin University after transferring to a Bachelor’s of Environmental Science. Before coming to study at Charles Darwin University he worked in the construction industry for close to 4 years, and also in the farming sector for a short time.

25 years old, born in Broome, Western Australia, his early childhood was spent living in remote communities in North Western W.A. before moving between various towns and cities throughout Western Australia in his late childhood, adolescence and early adulthood, he is currently based Darwin, the Northern Territory. An Australian citizen, though subsequently awarded a Lithuanian citizenship as part of a reparations scheme for the descendants of refugees and displaced persons in 2010. Now a dual citizen of both countries.

A practicing artist, whose work has appeared in a number of shows and galleries, most notably exhibited in The Art Gallery of Western Australia in the 2009. Additionally, he has worked as a freelance graphic designer with work appearing in publications and projects across the country.

His other current major research project is as the lead designer for the mHealth app emojifit. Working to develop both user interface and in-app communication tools, focusing on chronic disease care, prevention and education. An invited international speaker at the European Telehealth Conference (EHiN-FH / ETC 2016) in Oslo, Norway and the Steno Diabetes Centre in Copenhagen, Denmark discussing the potential that design and visual communication techniques offer the health sector in providing services in inter-cultural contexts and to low literacy individuals and communities.
